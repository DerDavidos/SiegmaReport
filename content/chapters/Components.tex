\chapter{Components}

In this chapter, all relevant parts of the system are explained and reasons are given why they were selected.

\section{Stepper driver}

TMC2209s were selected as stepper drivers because they offer a UART interface that provides reliable communication and allows a wide range of settings. 
Up to four drivers can be connected simultaneously to one UART master. In addition, they operate almost silently. \cite{tmc2209} 

\section{Mototor}



\section{Micro Controller}

For the microcontrollers, the choice fell on the RP2040 \cite{rp2040}. With the help of the Raspberry Pi Pico SDK \cite{sdk} it is relatively easy to write programs in the C language for it. The peripherals include 2 UARTs for easy communication with the stepper drivers. 

The controllers were used in the form of the \textit{Tiny 2040} \cite{tiny2040}. The Tiny 2040 is a development board that complements the RP2040 with a USB-C connector and easily accessible IO pins.
